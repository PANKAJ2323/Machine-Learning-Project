# Machine-Learning-Project
Introduction:
Heart failure is a serious condition that affects millions of people worldwide. This project aims to analyze clinical records related to heart failure, leveraging data science techniques to identify patterns and risk factors. By utilizing machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization, this project provides valuable insights for medical research and early diagnosis.

Objective:
The main goals of this project are:

To explore and clean heart failure clinical records.
To identify significant features contributing to heart failure.
To build predictive models for early diagnosis and risk assessment.
To visualize trends and correlations in the dataset.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset consists of multiple clinical features collected from patients, including:

Age: Age of the patient.
Sex: Male or Female.
Ejection Fraction: A measure of heart efficiency.
Serum Creatinine: Kidney function indicator.
Diabetes: Whether the patient has diabetes.
Smoking: Smoking status of the patient.
Death Event: The target variable indicating patient survival.

Technologies Used:
Python for data analysis and modeling.
Pandas & NumPy for data processing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization.
Scikit-learn for machine learning models.
Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding.
